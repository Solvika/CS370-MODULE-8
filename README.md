README FILE

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? 
The provided code is the game setup code, which consists of GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py.
What code did you create yourself? 
I developed the code that incorporates the reinforcement learning algorithm, and I designed game loops that leverage the Keras and Tensorflow libraries to achieve the pathfinding solution.
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists help solve and identify complex problems with technology in advanced ways. They employ algorithms, data structures, and innovative programming techniques to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in various applications. By leveraging their expertise, they can create solutions that improve everyday life and drive progress across multiple industries.
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? 
As a computer scientist with a technical mindset, I tackled this problem by applying my knowledge and available resources to solve it effectively.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? 
In carrying out their responsibilities, computer scientists have ethical obligations to both the end user and the organization. Taking this course has changed my understanding as a developer of machines, learning about the ethical responsibilities to both the end user and customer.
